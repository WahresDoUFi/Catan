# Catan
Settlers of Catan - the online board game

## Preamble
On your journey across the Atlantic in search of new territories for your king, you come across a small island called Catan.
You order your crew to go ashore and establish a small settlement to serve as a hub for future exploration and expansion.
The island turns out to be rich in resources, with fertile soil for farming and a deep forest that provides a steady supply of wood for its new inhabitants.

However, you are not alone. Other nations have independently discovered Catan and are attempting to build their own settlements. Should you trade with them, ignore them, or actively hinder their expansion?

So far from your kingdom, the decision rests solely with you. Choose wisely.

## Gameplay
The game is played in two phases. In the first phase, the players take turns building their initial settlements.
This phase lasts for two rounds, after which each player will have built two settlements and two roads, each connected to one of their settlements.

Afterward, the regular game begins. Players take turns by first rolling the dice and then constructing new buildings or trading with other players or the bank.

### Startphase
- Place Settlement
- Connect Road to it
- Next Players turn

### Regular game
- Roll the dice.
- Each player receives resources based on the number of settlements they have adjacent to tiles matching the rolled number. Only tiles without Shrek can produce resources.
- The active player may now build roads, settlements, or cities. They may also purchase Development Cards.
- The active player can send trade offers to other players or accept incoming offers. (Other players cannot trade among themselves.)

### Rolling a 7
If a player rolls a seven, Shrek becomes active and takes half of the resource cards from any player who has seven or more cards.
The player who rolled the seven may then place Shrek on any discovered tile and steal one additional resource card from a player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.
Once Shrek occupies a tile, no resources can be produced on that tile until he is moved elsewhere.

## How to win
The first player to reach 7 Victory Points wins the game.
There are five different ways to obtain Victory Points:
- Settlements – Each settlement grants 1 Victory Point.
- Cities – Each city grants 2 Victory Points.
- Longest Road – The player with the longest continuous road (at least 5 connected road segments) earns 2 Victory Points.
- Largest Army – The player who has played the most Knight Cards (at least 3 played) earns 2 Victory Points.
- Victory Point Cards – Each Victory Point Card grants 1 Victory Point.

## Development Cards
To accelerate their progress, players can purchase Development Cards. These cards are drawn at random and provide various benefits:

- Victory Point (20%): Grants you +1 Victory Point when played.
- Knight Card (48%): Allows you to move Shrek to another tile. After moving Shrek, you may steal one resource card from a player who has a settlement adjacent to the tile you chose.
- Road Building (8%): Gives you 2 roads for free.
- Year of Plenty (8%): Allows you to take 2 resource cards of your choice.
- Monopoly (8%): Lets you choose one type of resource; all other players must give you all cards they have of that type.
- Hanged Knights (8%): When this card is played, all of your opponents’ Knight Cards are discarded, except for one each.
